    "description": "Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bram, and I'm a passionate tech enthusiast and experienced mobile app developer who specialises in Flutter. I've been tinkering with coding since I was a kid, and started my career as an Android / Xamarin developer.\n\nI started working with Flutter when it was still in beta back in 2018, and it really was love at first sight. Working with Flutter has been a dream come true for me. The framework is incredibly user-friendly and the possibilities are endless. I'm excited to continue creating innovative Flutter apps that make a difference.\n\nWhen I'm not working, I love experimenting with augmented reality and engaging with my fellow card game enthusiasts.",
