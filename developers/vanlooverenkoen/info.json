    "description": "Hello there! I'm Koen, a 27-year-old professional with a passion for mobile app development. My journey began as an Android developer, where I honed my skills and gained valuable experience. However, I soon noticed a growing demand for cross-platform solutions in the industry.\n\nAlways eager to embrace new technologies, I decided to venture into Flutter even before its stable release. It was a leap of faith that turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made in my career. Flutter's versatility and efficiency captured my attention, and I haven't looked back since.\n\nIn addition to my individual endeavors, I am an active member of FlutterBelgium, a vibrant community dedicated to promoting Flutter in Belgium. As part of this community, I collaborate with fellow enthusiasts to organise engaging meetups, share knowledge, and foster a thriving Flutter community throughout the country.",
